        many students need a large amount of financial aid or to take out loans, 
        often both, in order to cover the cost of tuition and housing. Even then, 
        some still need to work full time to make ends meet. This was not always 
        the case; colleges have gotten more expensive over time, far more expensive
        in fact. For many students the question becomes completing their education or 
        being able to eat, or have secure housing. This issue has only been 
        exacerbated over time, especially by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown."),

  and universities in Washington State determined that 38.3% of students experienced
  some level of food insecurity within the last 30 days alone, while 34.2% of students
  experienced housing insecurity, and these numbers are only increasing. While students 
  being unable to eat or losing their housing is a serious issue, even less extreme levels
  of food insecurity can have drastic effects on their livelihood; students who have a poor 
  diet due to a lack of access to healthy food options experience physical and mental 
  health side effects, such as low energy levels and higher stress. 
  These issues, alongside increased worries about food in general, can cause 
  students' grades to drop. In addition, if students are struggling with school 
  due to food and housing insecurity, they are more likely to drop out due to 
  the high cost of attendance; this widens the socioeconomic educational gap, 
  making it even harder for students without a lot of financial support from 
  their families to attend college."),

        requirements for these jobs often including a college degree, and the lack of
