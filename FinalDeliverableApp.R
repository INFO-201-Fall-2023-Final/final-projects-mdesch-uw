        some still need to work full time to make ends meet. This was not always

        in fact. For many students the question becomes completing their education or

  some level of food insecurity within the last 30 days alone, while 34.2% of students
  experienced housing insecurity, and these numbers are only increasing. While students 
  being unable to eat or losing their housing is a serious issue, even less extreme levels
  of food insecurity can have drastic effects on their livelihood; students who have a poor 
  diet due to a lack of access to healthy food options experience physical and mental 
  health side effects, such as low energy levels and higher stress. 
  These issues, alongside increased worries about food in general, can cause 
  students' grades to drop. In addition, if students are struggling with school 
  due to food and housing insecurity, they are more likely to drop out due to 
  the high cost of attendance; this widens the socioeconomic educational gap,
